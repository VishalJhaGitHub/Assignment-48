    "#Simple Linear Regression:\n",

The model assumes that the relationship between the independent variable and the dependent variable can be represented by a straight line.\n",

    "#Example of Simple Linear Regression:\n",
    "#Suppose we want to examine the relationship between the number of hours studied (independent variable) and the exam score (dependent variable) for a group of students. We collect data from 50 students, recording the number of hours studied and their corresponding exam scores. Using simple linear regression, we can estimate the linear relationship between the hours studied and the exam scores and predict the exam score based on the number of hours studied.\n",

    "#Multiple Linear Regression:\n",
    "#Multiple linear regression involves two or more independent variables and one dependent variable. It extends the concept of simple linear regression to account for the influence of multiple factors on the dependent variable. The model assumes a linear relationship between the dependent variable and each independent variable, holding the other independent variables constant.\n",

    "#Let's say we want to predict the price of a house based on its size (in square feet), the number of bedrooms, and the age of the house. We collect data from 100 houses, recording the size, number of bedrooms, age, and their corresponding prices. Using multiple linear regression, we can estimate how each independent variable (size, number of bedrooms, and age) contributes to the price of the house and make predictions for new houses based on these variables."

    "#Linear regression makes several assumptions to ensure the validity and reliability of the model. These assumptions are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "#1 - Linearity: The relationship between the independent variables and the dependent variable is linear. This means that the effect of the independent variables on the dependent variable is additive.\n",
    "\n",
    "#2 - Independence: The observations in the dataset are independent of each other. There should be no correlation or dependence between the observations.\n",
    "\n",
    "#3 - Homoscedasticity: The variance of the errors is constant across all levels of the independent variables. In other words, the spread of the residuals should be consistent throughout the range of predicted values.\n",
    "\n",
    "#4 - Normality: The residuals (the differences between the observed and predicted values) are normally distributed. This assumption allows for valid statistical inference and hypothesis testing.\n",
    "\n",
    "#5 - No multicollinearity: There should be little to no multicollinearity among the independent variables. Multicollinearity occurs when two or more independent variables are highly correlated, which can make it difficult to determine their individual effects on the dependent variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "#To check whether these assumptions hold in a given dataset, several diagnostic techniques can be used:\n",
    "\n",
    "#1 - Residual analysis: Examine the residuals to assess linearity, homoscedasticity, and normality assumptions. Plotting the residuals against the predicted values can help identify patterns or nonlinear relationships. Histograms or Q-Q plots of the residuals can indicate departures from normality.\n",
    "\n",
    "#2 - Durbin-Watson test: This test assesses the presence of autocorrelation in the residuals. It checks if there is a systematic relationship between residuals at different time points.\n",

    "#The slope represents the change in the dependent variable for a unit change in the independent variable. It indicates the rate at which the dependent variable changes as the independent variable increases by one unit, assuming all other variables are held constant. A positive slope suggests a positive relationship, meaning that as the independent variable increases, the dependent variable tends to increase as well. Conversely, a negative slope indicates a negative relationship, where an increase in the independent variable is associated with a decrease in the dependent variable.\n",

It indicates the baseline value of the dependent variable when the independent variable has no effect. It is the value on the y-axis where the regression line crosses it.\n",

This positive slope indicates that as students dedicate more time to studying, their exam scores tend to increase.\n",
    "\n",
    "#The intercept of 62.3 represents the estimated exam score when a student has not studied at all (0 hours of study). It serves as the baseline score for a student who hasn't put in any study effort. It suggests that, without any studying, a student can expect to achieve a score of 62.3."

It allows the models to learn from data by iteratively updating their parameters to minimize the error. By optimizing the parameters through gradient descent, the models become better at making predictions and capturing patterns in the data.\n",
